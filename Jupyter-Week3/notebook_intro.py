# ## 1) Click HERE only once (so the blue bar shows up on the left)

# ## 5) Now press B to create a new cell below the cursor – or A for above.

# ## 6) Practice step 5 a few times

# ## 7) Press ESC and use your arrow keys to highlight one of the new empty cells you created

# ## 8)  Delete the empty cell by pressing d + d (be careful!)

print("good job!")


# A few notes:
# 
# - Rows can contain many different languages, today we're just using Python
# - We can also use Markdown in cells and display pictures, web sites, etc
# - When in doubt, press ESC once to exit editing mode and use your arrows, A, B, dd, etc

# ## 10) Finally, go to File > Download as > Python (.py) to save this as a Python file
